# What is a Pointer Type?
## Pointer types in C# are variables that store memory addresses of another type or variable. A pointer can refer to an object of any one data type, it cannot refer to a bit field or a reference.  For example, an integer variable holds an integer value, however an integer pointer holds the address of a integer variable.

# When are Pointer Types used?
## Pointers are frequently used when interacting with unmanaged code, this allows C# code to pass data directly to and from these unmanaged functions which often expect memory addresses. Pointer types in C# are used in specific scenarios where direct memory manipulation is required, typically in conjunction with "unsafe" code blocks.
